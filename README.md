This Python project serves as an employee management system. It allows users to perform various operations such as adding new employees, listing all existing employees, deleting employees within a specified age range, updating an employee's salary, and ending the program.

The program consists of two main classes: `Employee` and `EmployeesManager`. 

- The `Employee` class represents individual employees with attributes such as name, age, and salary.

- The `EmployeesManager` class manages a collection of employees, providing methods to add, remove, update, and display employee information.

Additionally, there's a `FrontEndManager` class which acts as the user interface, enabling users to interact with the employee management system through a command-line interface. It continuously prompts users to select from a menu of options and executes the corresponding functionality based on the user's choice.

Overall, this project offers a simple yet effective solution for managing employee data within a Python environment.
